# SSc_biomarker_manuscript

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multifactorial autoimmune fibrotic disorder involving complex rewiring of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic signaling circuits involving a range of cell types. However, the rewired circuits as well as corresponding cell-cell interactions remain poorly understood. 

To address this, we first used a predictive machine learning framework to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data from 24 SSc patients across the severity (as quantified by the Modified Rodnan Skin Score) spectrum and 6 healthy controls. We found that the uncovered cell-type-specific predictive biomarkers of MRSS included previously implicated genes in fibroblast and myeloid cell subsets (e.g., SFPR2+ fibroblasts and monocytes), as well as novel gene biomarkers of MRSS, especially in keratinocytes.

Correlation network analyses unveiled novel cross-talk between immune pathways as well as implicated keratinocytes in addition to fibroblast and myeloid cells as key cell-types involved in SSc pathogenesis.
